## Background and Overview
We are currently developing a social media app that will feature user profiles and showcase their “pages.” Users will be able to create a new page by posting a photo of their outfit and linking to specific articles of clothing. Other users can follow, like, comment on, and share these pages via a link.
Additionally, users will be able to edit or delete their pages as needed. When creating a new page, users will be prompted to fill out a form that includes links to specific articles of clothing. Users will then have the option to place a marker on a grid, which, when clicked, will display the link to that specific article of clothing.
